			<h3> About Me </h3>
			<hr/>
			<h5> Wisconsin raised.  Seattle based. </h5>
			<p>
				I'm a natural creative and problem solver.  Always been that way.  As a kid, I was already making paper objects and charts straight from my imagination and obsessively built fictional worlds.  Now I put my ingenuity and passion to work building software.  Oh, and I still worldbuild.
			</p>
			<p>
				My venture into software is rooted in my passion for creating things and for the amazing potential technology has for people.  As such, I've assembled a wealth of experience working at every level of the software stack across a broad spectrum of technologies.
