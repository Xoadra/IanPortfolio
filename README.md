# Ian Peterson's Portfolio

Visit the website at: https://ianpeterson.io/

I built the website using the React framework alongside GitHub's API to reference the repos and their data of the works I have for show.  While it previously ran on a Node.js backend and was hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, it is now hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), a static site hosting platform.

All data you see on the website is hardcoded in as the website doesn't currently use a database.  However, I may incorporate a database to it in the future.  Using a database now seems excessive and unnecessary when making simple website updates such as project changes is very easy and quick.

The website is a continual work in progress as I continue to improve upon its design and update the portfolio pieces on display.
