# Ian Peterson's Portfolio

Visit the website at: https://ianpeterson.io/

I built the website using the React framework that runs on a Node.js backend.  I also utilize GitHub's API to reference the repos and their data of the works I have for show.  It is currently hosted on an AWS EC2 instance.

All data you see on the website is hardcoded in as the website doesn't currently use a database.  However, I may incorporate a small MongoDB or other NoSQL database to it in the future.  Using a database now seems excessive and unnecessary when making simple website updates such as project changes is very easy and quick.

The website is a work in progress as I continue to improve upon its design and update the portfolio pieces on display.  Keep checking back in the following days and weeks as it comes together as an embodiment of my technical expertise.
